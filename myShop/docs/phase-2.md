# Phase 2: Architecture Design

## 1. Define Application Requirements:

- Clearly outline the functional requirements of your application.
- Identify the use cases and user stories that your application needs to support.
- Define the data model and entities required for your application.

## 2. Identify Microservices:
- Break down the application requirements into smaller, manageable services.
- Identify the boundaries and responsibilities of each microservice.
- Determine the communication patterns and dependencies between microservices.

## 3. Choose AWS Services:
- Select AWS services that best fit the requirements of each microservice.
- Consider factors such as scalability, availability, durability, and cost-effectiveness.
- Map each microservice to its corresponding AWS services, such as Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SQS, etc.

## 4. Design Event Schema:
- Define the schema for events that will be exchanged between microservices.
- Determine the structure and content of events, including event types, headers, and payload.

## 5. Establish Communication Protocols:
- Choose communication protocols and standards for inter-service communication.
- Decide on the message format (e.g., JSON, Avro, Protocol Buffers) and serialization/deserialization mechanisms.

## 7. Security and Authentication:
- Design security measures for authenticating and authorizing requests between microservices.
- Implement mechanisms such as IAM roles, API Gateway authentication, and encryption of data in transit.

## 8. Error Handling and Resilience:
- Define strategies for error handling and fault tolerance in a distributed system.
- Implement mechanisms for retrying failed operations, handling partial failures, and ensuring eventual consistency.

## 9. Monitoring and Logging:
- Plan for monitoring and logging of microservices and AWS resources.
- Decide on metrics, alarms, and dashboards to monitor system health and performance.
- Implement logging strategies to capture relevant information for debugging and troubleshooting.

## 10. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
- Explore tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to define and manage your infrastructure as code.
- Write templates to provision and configure AWS resources required for your microservices architecture.

## 11. Documentation:
- Document the architecture design decisions, including rationale, trade-offs, and considerations.
- Create diagrams, such as architecture diagrams, sequence diagrams, and data flow diagrams, to illustrate the system design.

# Deliverables for Phase 2:
- Architecture design document outlining the high-level design of the event-driven microservices application.
- Event schema definition document detailing the structure and content of events.
- Communication protocols and security measures documentation.
- Infrastructure as code templates for provisioning AWS resources.
- Monitoring and logging setup instructions.
